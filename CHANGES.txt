# v1.3.0 - 6/13/2025

* Add support for 13mm stickbox, to allow compatibility OOTB with dualsense-style stickboxes
* Widen footprint to allow original Hori stickbox as well
* Additional info on silkscreens to aid in assembly

# v1.2.0 - 12/13/2024

* Switch to dualsense-style pinout for potentiometers (was ps4 before)
* Add tactile button trigger boards (credit: Noah Cardosi)  
* Add TVSes for voltage protection
* More debug pins

# v1.1.X - ??/??/2024

Lost track of these, but we did some various prototypes in this time.
At some point, a standard 3-pin potentiometer pinout got added.
3-axis digital sensors eventually got removed. All the LPF stuff got thrown away as we switched to pre-assembled halls in the pot form factor.

# v1.0.0 - 9/23/2023

* Redesign stickboard to support 2 types of sensors: 3-axis digital sensors (LIS3MDL), and analog through-hole hall sensors (DRV5055).
* Replaced Mini USB connector with USB-C, also supporting BOXX-style USB-C to N64 once installed using solder pads
* Switch to I2C serial communication for interfacing with ADC & digital sensors.
* Completely redone layout to optimize noise, EMI, reliability, etc.
* Added testpoints for extra GPIO pins and all buttons for future modding
* Switched to a different FFC cable/connector to accomodate new stickboard interface (6 -> 10 pins)
* Added footprints to install extra capacitors to configure stick LPF behavior
* Improved board outline for better fit
* Added fuses for safety
* Added logo, product name & version, designer credits, source file location with licensing info

# First prototype - 6/8/2023
 
Schematic:
 
Phobri64 reuses most of the same circuit elements from the PhobGCC, namely:
 
 * Hall effect + LPF + ADC subsystem (specifically for the cstick board, because it attaches separately like the hori does)
 * Crystal circuit
 * Flash circuit
 * N64/GCC bus + USB power delivery circuitry ( & ESD device)
 * RP2040 + bypass capacitors
 
It removes the remaining components such as analog trigger support, motor control, the 2nd stick, and the resistor ladder DAC for composite out.

Layout:

The Hori pad mini uses a vastly different layout than the GCC so little is shared here. Mainly the footprints for the button contacts have been copied over and resized slightly to fit better with the hori motherboard. Some footprints for components not present in KiCad's library have also been copied over.
